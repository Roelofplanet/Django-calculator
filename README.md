Calculator application using Django on the backend and Bootstrap on the frontend.
Using the python math library to make the calculations in the python functions written in the views.py file.
Every calculation button uses a HTML template for input and another HTML template to display the result.
The result from the calculations will be stored in a python dictonary and passed on the HTML result template.
Every HTML template has it's own url in the urls.py file. 
For syling I used Bootstrap 5 CDN links and a CSS static file in the Django root directory.
